This repository contains an implementation of the famous Sokoban game, written in Yeti.

This implementation was written only as an exercise to get acquainted with Yeti programming.
Please beware that some of the files here may be subject to copyright (in particular icons and levels).

To launch the game from Yeti REPL, type:

> load sokoban
> game maze1

A Window appears with a sokoban level. You can use arrow keys to play, and ESC to quit the game.
Current version is very limited, but future versions may include the following features:
- load sokoban level files (.slc)
- display level and moves count
- undo moves
