This repository contains an implementation of the famous Sokoban game, written in Yeti.

This implementation was written only as an exercise to get acquainted with Yeti programming.
Please beware that some of the files here may be subject to copyright (in particular icons and levels).

To launch the game from Yeti REPL, type:

> load sokoban
> sokoban "Learning_Sokoban.slc"

A Window appears with a sokoban level. You can use arrow keys to play, and ESC to quit the game.
You can also undo your last move (and previous ones if you need) by typing "z".
You can restart from a level from the start by typing "r".

Sorry for french messages, this game is for my daughter!

I will possibly add a few features soon:
- display level and moves count
- better UI to load an SLC file
